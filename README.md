# Overview

Currently working on building some nice RPM packages for Apache Tomcat. Currently there are some available but I either don't like the way thier built, or think there a bit over complicated.

# Objectives

1. Build a base tomcat install that has just the base tomcat, there will be no startup scripts or webapps.
2. Package up a web application in it's with it's own data, configuration and startup file.

# References

These packages will be based on the best pieces from:

* [JPackage Site](http://jpackage.org)
* [webdriod.org](http://webdroid.org/archives/tomcat-package/)
